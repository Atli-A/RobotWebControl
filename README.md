# RobotWebControl


This project is unfinished and not entirely working.
I recommend that you do not install this until it works


The core functionality mostly works however it needs some calibration


Just a piece of adviece but currently the only way to easily kill the program is to ssh into it and type:

```sh
    $ fuser -k -n tcp 8888
```
